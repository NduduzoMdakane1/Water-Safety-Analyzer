Water Safety Analyzer: Metal Concentration Checker

This code analyzes metal concentration data from an Excel file and evaluates safety levels.

What it does:
- Compares calculated concentrations of metals to reference safe limits
- Applies a customizable safety margin for each metal
- Classifies each metal as 'Safe', 'Unsafe', or 'Borderline'
- Outputs a clear summary including safety status for each entry

Could be useful for basic water quality checks using lab data (e.g. AAS or ICP-OES results).
